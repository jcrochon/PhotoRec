# PhotoRec

Hi, I was looking for a better script than what was posted than what was here http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/After_Using_PhotoRec

I wouldn't need to waste space by copying the files, like the previous script.
This script moves files, and compares the sizes. 
It keeps a duplicate if its less than the previous size, and puts it into a dupes folder, or to replace the current file with a bigger copy, in hopes for a 2nd chance recovery.

I hope this helps some of you who have little drive space, for recovery.
1. Start the PhotoRec session
2. Stop the PhotoRec session
3. Start the script: script.py [source] [destination]
4. Manage your sorted files (delete, move, et cetera)
5. Start the PhotoRec session, and restore previous session
